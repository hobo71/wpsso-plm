== Description ==

<p style="margin:0;"><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-plm/assets/icon-256x256.png"></p>

**Let Pinterest, Facebook and Google know about your location(s):**

Include Pinterest Rich Pin *Place*, Facebook / Open Graph *Location*, and Google *Local Business / Local SEO* meta tags in your webpages.

**The WPSSO Place / Location and Local Business Meta (aka WPSSO PLM) add-on can be used in two different ways:**

* To provide location information for the webpage content (ie. the post/page content is about a specific physical place / location).

* To provide location information for an Organization, which in turn may be related to the content (ie. the content publisher, event organizer, etc.).

The Free version of WPSSO PLM can provide location information for the [WPSSO Organization Markup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-organization/) (aka WPSSO ORG) add-on.

The WPSSO Organization Markup (aka WPSSO ORG) add-on is required to select a place / location for an organization / local business.
